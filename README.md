Project Name: Bank Tele-Marketing Data Analysis 
Project Type: Supervised Machine Learning Model using Classification

Problem Statement:
This project established a model to predict the outcome of a bank term-deposit telemarketing campaign and analyzed client's response to the term deposit promoting with various client's attributes. Increase the effectiveness of the bank's telemarketing campaign using supervised Machine Learning Classification Algorithams.

Main Goal of Our Project:
(1) analyze how various features can influence the telemarketing campaign response,which will help bank tellers to improve telemarketing efficiency. 
(2) develop machine learning models that can help bank or bank tellers to predict the response of the clients. 
(3) analyzed the different business scenarios, based on evaluation results of various models, interpreted different metrics for different business situations, make suggestions to bank or bank tellers regarding how to use models.
